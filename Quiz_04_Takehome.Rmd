“All work presented is my own, and I have followed all rules for collaboration.”

I collaborated with Claire Dudley and Emil Zetterquist for this quiz. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
library(devtools)
library(maps) 

us.cities <- maps::us.cities
```

```{r}
us.capitals <- 
us.cities %>%
  filter(., capital == "2")

```

```{r}
capital_map <- leaflet(us.capitals) %>%
  setView(lng = -98.583, lat = 39.833, zoom = 4) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Terrain) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = us.capitals$long, lat = us.capitals$lat,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             popup = paste("Name:", us.capitals$name, "<br>", "Population:", us.capitals$pop, "<br>"))

capital_map
```
